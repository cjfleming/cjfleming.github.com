	<p><font face="sans-serif"> One of my favorite memories from childhood, or to be completely honest near adulthood, was spending a Friday night reenacting civil war battles with stuffed animals and three of my closest human friends. That moment encompassed everything I wanted out of life: a subject matter I was interested in, a creative outlet for telling a story, and a connection to people with whom I could both share and learn from. While the others walked away from that moment feeling badly about not having spent it partying like normal kids, I felt true to myself and my passions.</p>
