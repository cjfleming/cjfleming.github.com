	<h1>Carly Fleming</h1>
	<p>One of my favorite memories from childhood, or to be completely honest near adulthood, was spending a Friday night reenacting civil war battles with stuffed animals and three of my closest human friends. That moment encompassed everything I wanted out of life: a subject matter I was interested in, a creative outlet for telling a story, and a connection to people with whom I could both share and learn from. While the others walked away from that moment feeling badly about not having spent it partying like normal kids, I felt true to myself and my passions. Today, I am interested in behavior and decision-making, particularly as it relates to politics. I love telling stories through the language of data and succinct prose. I aim to build communities through websites and online engagement.</p>
