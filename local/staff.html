						<p>I grew up in a small town in western Pennsylvania and was surrounded by entrepreneurship at an early age. Working at a small business started by my parents, I learned the importance of community and working hard to deliver a quality product. The desire to further my understanding of business led me to attend business school and subsequently pursue a career in Finance.

						After seven years in finance, it was time for a change. My passion for the amazing story of coffee and cocktails led me to leave my job and go back to my roots in local business. I now hope to follow in the footsteps of my parents’ entrepreneurial spirit and share my love of coffee and cocktails with Logan Circle and the Washington, DC community.

						<p>After college I became a nurse; driven by a love for critical thinking in a fast paced environment and the desire to make a difference in people's lives.  A few years ago, I moved into project management where I focused on improving the quality of patient care through technology.

						Now, I am excited to bring my focus on quality of life to the food and service at Slipstream. My Italian grandmother instilled in me a love of food that inspired a passion for quality ingredients and the care and attention that go into pairing them. It is easy to sacrifice eating well in the midst of a busy lifestyle, but I hope to make it equally easy to access delicious, socially conscious food.
